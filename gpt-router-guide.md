React Router Dom is a popular library in the React ecosystem that allows for easy navigation and routing between pages in a single-page web application. In this guide, we will go through the steps required to install and use React Router Dom in a React application.

Step 1: Install React Router Dom

First, you need to install the React Router Dom library. You can install it using the command below:

```
npm install react-router-dom --save
```

Step 2: Implement Router

After installing the library, we need to import React Router Domâ€™s Router component and wrap it around our React components. This will allow us to define the routing configuration for our application.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Here we have set up three routes for the pages Home, About, and Contact. If none of these paths match, then the NotFound component will be rendered.

Step 3: Create Your Components

The pages that you want to navigate should be defined as components that can be rendered by React.

```js
import React from 'react';

function Home() {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
}

function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}

function Contact() {
  return <h1>Contact Us</h1>;
}

function NotFound() {
  return <h1>404 Not Found</h1>;
}
```

Step 4: Use Links to Navigate Between Pages

To navigate between pages, we use the Link component from React Router Dom. This component allows us to create links that trigger page transitions.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Navbar />
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        <Route component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

In the above code, we create a navbar component that contains the links to navigate between pages. The Link component provides the to prop, which specifies the URL path that the link should lead to. When clicking the link, the page transition is triggered, and the corresponding route component is mounted.

Congratulations! You have now learned how to install and use React Router Dom in a React application. By following these steps, you can efficiently navigate between different pages and components in your application.
